# StockMarketAnalysis
Analysing Stock Market Data using Kafka <br />
<br />
This a project that I am developing for learning purposes. I have used this youtube video for reference :  [Stock Market Real-time Data Analysis using Kafka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KerNf0NANMo)

# Steps in the project

- [Setting up EC2 Instance](#setting-up-EC2-Instance)    
- [Downloading Kafka on EC2 Instance](#downloading-Kafka-on-EC2-Instance)
- [Starting Zookeeper and Kafka server on local machine](#starting-Zookeeper-and-Kafka-server-on-local-machine)
- [Creating topic on Kafka server](#creating-topic-on-Kafka-server)
- [Creating producer and consumer on our server](#creating-producer-and-consumer-on-our-server)
- [Writing python code for Kafka producer and consumer in python on Jupyter Notebook](#writing-python-code-for-Kafka-producer-and-consumer-in-python-on-Jupyter-Notebook)
- [Simulating realtime data using a dataset](#simulating-realtime-data-using-a-dataset)
- [Setting up S3 Bucket](#setting-up-S3-Bucket)
- [Setting up Glue crawler](#setting-up-Glue-crawler)
- [Quering our data using AWS Athena](#quering-our-data-using-AWS-Athena)

# Setting up EC2 Instance

First, [Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email) and activate it, which will take approximately 24 hours.
