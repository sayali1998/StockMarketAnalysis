- [Creating topic on Kafka server](#creatingtopiconKafkaserver)
- [Creating producer and consumer on our server](#creatingproducerandconsumeronourserver)
- [Writing python code for Kafka producer and consumer in python on Jupyter Notebook](#writingpythoncodeforKafkaproducerandconsumerinpythononJupyterNotebook)
- [Simulating realtime data using a dataset](#simulatingrealtimedatausingadataset)
- [Setting up S3 Bucket](#settingupS3Bucket)
- [Setting up Glue crawler](#settingupGluecrawler)
- [Quering our data using AWS Athena](#queringourdatausingAWSAthena)

# Setting up EC2 Instance

First, [Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email) and activate it, which will take approximately 24 hours.
